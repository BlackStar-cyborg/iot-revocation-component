##Smart Contracts

Eryk said that we would probably use #ethereum, which uses #solidity as programming language.
[Getting Started](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/)

### Proof of stake

- Consensus Mechanism
- less energy intensive
- instead of proving computation, validators stake capital e.g., ETH and gets destroyed if the
  validator behaves dishonestly or lazily.
- To become a validator you need to deposit 32 ETH

## Scenarios / Use Cases

Consists of

1. Domain Description
2. Stakeholder Definition
3. Description of system under analysis
4. Scenarios

Eryk thought Aircraft use case would be most interesting, as micro-factories is not very ripe and
artwork does not interest me.
