Meeting with Eryk Schiller, 2pm@ifi

- Research and read through proposals, mainly WP1 and its use-cases
- #DNS and #blockchain variants
    - If using #DLT / #Blockchain, consider #ETH instead of
- write up how each milestone should look like
	- implementations and write-up
- Think about using #MUD and DID to deliver
	- DID: distributable ID
- using #MicroPython, assuming firmware to be stable but the `.py` files not!
- What platform?
	- could be with or even without OS
	- With or without SE from STM: **WIP**
	- My suggestion was `Raspberry Pi Pico`
	- someone else is working on top Pi4 alternative (RockPi)
- #PUF for #SRAM
	- Physically unclonable function
	 - usable for key/DID generation used for verifiable credentials, VC, later on
- Consider roaming for devices, especially use case 1, aircraft cabin
- I will be designing many #API for different parts, updating, checking etc.

## TODO
- [x] Check Mail, should come today
- [x] Read through documents
- [x] Elaborate each milestone, whether only write-up or implementation
- [x] Create GitHub repo at some point `CERTIFY-devintsec`
