## my questions

- secure updating documents (Schiller)
  - ask Antonio
- hardware to experiment on (Rodrigues)
  - ask Stefano

## notes

- address scalability
  - group devices, e.g, by relational database
  - json web token to group devices and include devices to be revoked
  - Iroha uses key/value pairs which can be stored to imitate a database
  - Hyperledger Orion
- two chains considered for UZH
  - Aries and Ethereum
- smart descriptors for sec information sharing
- SQLite for devices?
- consider Interledger approach/ using multiple ledgers and interchangeability.

## TODO

- [ ] paper from Antonio
  - read through and get differences "An Interledger Blockchain Platform for Cross-Border Management of Cybersecurity Information"
