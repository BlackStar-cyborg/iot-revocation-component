## Meeting 3 with Eryk

- PUF is not focus for me, consider more hardcoded IDs and assume authentication.
- Source code should be available though from Sina, colleague from Eryk.
- Secure storage for device key will probably be a TPM.

- hardware, need to agree with collins and the girl who does DAA

- wait for paper on secure upgrading, until 2023-07-07, Fr.

- related work section, explain and highlight different technologies.

- structure disconnection/revoking of credentials
- how to do recertification

- VC has to be scalable, upgrading as well, imagine millions of devices getting their VC revoked
  - if smart contract depends on cryptographic accumulator then it might fail, or too slow etc.
- discuss with Eryk how it scalable

- recertification might be client-server based, don't overcomplicate it, in general use existing
technologies.
