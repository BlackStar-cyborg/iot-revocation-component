We will be holding the 2nd meeting today.

I have following questions on the table:

- Review small document I made.
- How to proceed generally
  - building on 'connected cabin system' use case

---

Consider different responsibilities

- align with Collins on:
  - use case, mimic what they have
    - connectivity
  - hardware platform
  - protocols
- simulating device, from Collins
  - specific software simulator
  - FGPA
- create functional architecture
- we will be (loosely) matching the CERTIFY!
  - extend use cases
  - roaming, besides from CCS, not really taken in account from CERTIFY
    - globally available devices and identities
- choose hyper ledger
  - specific properties the satisfy our needs
  - need justification
  - research what platforms may be sufficient
- how to handle devices in flight?
  - did saved in global repositories

---

## TODO

- Create functional architecture based on Collins use case / Deliverable 1.1
- Research blockchains that could/would be functional
