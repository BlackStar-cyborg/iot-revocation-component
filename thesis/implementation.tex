\chapter{Implementation}
% Explain the implementation specifics and elaborate on some architectural decisions made in 4

For our implementation it was important that we do not reinvent the wheel at each corner.

Choosing a DLT platform was not easy, as there were many options for Blockchains/DLTs but very few that were more or
less directly applicable to our thesis, which is IoTeX but its permissionless nature is not of good to us, as we would
like our network to be permissioned, which is another increase in security.

Another aspect of was the quality of documentation. In order not to waste time trying to figure out the source code,
documentation of it is important.

The choice of physical devices, whose purpose lies with demonstrating our platforms capabilities, fell to the following.
For the controller nodes, we will be using Raspberry Pi 4B, demonstrating portability and the use of embedded Linux,
reflecting future capabilities. It is able to coordinate with the chosen blockchains.

For the edge nodes we have decided to use the Raspberry Pi Pico, which is a capable and demonstrative microcontroller
unit, MCU, able to run CircuitPython, as well as simple bare-metal software.

For sake of simplicity, an AAA server and process will be assumed and therefore no secure onboarding will be included.
