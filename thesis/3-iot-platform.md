# IoT Platform

## Central/Function Controller

For the Controllers, it would seem most fit to use a `Raspberry Pi 4` as they are computationally
very capable and would be a great fit for managing subnets and sub-nodes of the infrastructure.

## IoT Nodes

The current IoT platform is not yet specified, although a `raspberry pi pico` is being targeted as a
viable solution as it supports `MicroPython`, is cheap and has extensive processing power (2x M0+
cores at 110MHz)
