    abstractNote = {The integration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Blockchains
                    (BC) for trusted and decentralized approaches enabled modern
                    use cases, such as supply chain tracing, smart cities, and
                    IoT data marketplaces. For these it is essential to identify
                    reliably IoT devices, since the producer-consumer trust is
                    not guaranteed by a Trusted Third Party (TTP). Therefore,
                    this work proposes a Know Your IoT device platform (KYoT),
                    which enables the self-sovereign identiﬁcation of IoT devices
                    on the Ethereum BC. KYoT permits manufacturers and device
                    owners to register and verify IoT devices in a self-sovereign
                    fashion, while data storage security is ensured. KYoT deploys
                    an SRAM-based (Static Random Access Memory) Physically
                    Unclonable Function (PUF), which takes advantage of the
                    manufacturing variability of devices’ SRAM chips to derive a
                    unique identifying key for each IoT device. The
                    self-sovereign identiﬁcation mechanism introduced is based on
                    the ERC 734 and ERC 735 Ethereum identity standards.},
