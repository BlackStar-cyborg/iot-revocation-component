                    use cases, such as supply chain tracing, smart cities, and
                    IoT data marketplaces. For these it is essential to identify
                    reliably IoT devices, since the producer-consumer trust is
                    not guaranteed by a Trusted Third Party (TTP). Therefore,
                    this work proposes a Know Your IoT device platform (KYoT),
                    which enables the self-sovereign identiﬁcation of IoT devices
                    on the Ethereum BC. KYoT permits manufacturers and device
                    owners to register and verify IoT devices in a self-sovereign
                    fashion, while data storage security is ensured. KYoT deploys
                    an SRAM-based (Static Random Access Memory) Physically
                    Unclonable Function (PUF), which takes advantage of the
                    manufacturing variability of devices’ SRAM chips to derive a
                    unique identifying key for each IoT device. The
                    self-sovereign identiﬁcation mechanism introduced is based on
                    the ERC 734 and ERC 735 Ethereum identity standards.},

    abstractNote = {With the exorbitant growth in the number of connected
                    devices, the lack of proper identity and access management
                    (IAM) mechanisms has become a major concern. The traditional
                    IAM systems, which focus solely on managing people’s digital
                    identities, fail to accommodate billions of Internet of
                    Things (IoT) devices. The emerging concepts such as
                    decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials
                    (VCs) provide new perspectives on incorporating IAM
                    capabilities into IoT ecosystems. In this paper, we present a
                    decentralized IAM framework for IoT named DIAM-IoT, which is
                    able to create a unified, interoperable, and tamper-proof
                    device identity registry on top of the blockchain by
                    introducing DIDs and VCs into the lifecycle of IoT devices,
                    thereby breaking IoT application silos and unlocking the
                    potential of IoT on a global scale. A proof-of-concept
                    implementation of the DIAM-IoT framework for decentralized
                    and user-centric data authorization demonstrates its
                    feasibility and effectiveness in practice.},
