                Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs). The goal of MUD is to
                provide a means for end devices to signal to the network what
                sort of access and network functionality they require to properly
                function. The initial focus is on access control. Later work can
                delve into other aspects. This memo specifies two YANG modules,
                IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options, a Link Layer Discovery Protocol
                (LLDP) TLV, a URL, an X.509 certificate extension, and a means to
                sign and verify the descriptions.},
