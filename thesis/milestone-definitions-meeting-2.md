# Milestones

Need to specify what will be submitted

## Milestone 1: Definition of use cases incl. actors, requirements, and functionalities

[See use-case document](./use-cases.md)

What would I be to do here? There are already 3 use cases. Am I to define more? Or choose one of the
three use cases, favoring the aircraft cabin scenario, and expand upon further than current
documentation?

### Connected Cabin System

#### Goals
- Faster re-certification for devices entering/changing location.

- Config A and B
