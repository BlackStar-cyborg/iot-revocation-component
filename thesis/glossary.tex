	\item[Authentication] Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to
		allowing access to resources in an information system. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item[Accounting] Access privileges granted to a user, program, or process or the act of granting those
		privileges. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item[Authorization] Authorization is the decision whether an entity is allowed to perform a particular action
		or not, e.g. whether a user is allowed to attach to a network or not.
	\item[Trust Model] In the trust model the issuer issues credential to a holder while the holder can prove
		identity by showing the credential to a verifier.
	\item [Manufacturer Usage Description] A component-based architecture specified in Request for Comments (RFC)
	      8520 that is designed to provide a means for end devices to signal to the network what sort of access and
	      network functionality they require to properly function. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item [Cloud Computing] Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially
	      data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item [Fog Computing] As an extension of Cloud computing, Fog Computing brings the computation closer to IoT
	      Edge devices. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item [Edge Computing] Edge computing is the placement of storage and computing resources closer to source, where
	      the data is generated. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item [Line-Replaceable Unit] modular component of airplane, designed to be replaced quickly
	\item [Firmware] Computer programs and data stored in hardware - typically in read-only memory (ROM) or
	      programmable read-only memory (PROM) - such that the programs and data cannot be dynamically written
	      or modified during execution of the programs. \cite{nist:glossary}
	\item [Trusted Execution Zone] An area or enclave protected by a system processor. \cite{nist:glossary}
