\section{CERTIFY} % (fold)
\label{sec:CERTIFY}

This thesis is carried out in conjunction with the CERTIFY project \cite{certifyproject2023}.

The National Institute for Standard and Technology has a few ongoing projects and white papers on security related
mitigation methods for IoT devices.

\section{DLT-based Asset-Tracking} % (fold)
\label{sec:DLT-based Asset-Tracking}

Neisse et al. (2017) analyzed how blockchain-based approaches might be used for data accountability and provenance
tracking under the then recently released GDPR legislation, highlighting challenges of scalability and considering
sharding as a method to address it. \cite{neisse2017blockchain} Further they also mentioned issues of clonability of
the tracked assets, which we can also correlate to the physical assets that are tracked inside blockchain.

\label{sec:Cybersecurity of IoT Devices}


In order to maintain participation rights for only valid users/clients, Manufacturer Usage Descriptions, MUDs, are
getting more and more relevant, as also the National Institute for Standards and Technology, NIST, have been considering
their use cases. \cite{dodson2021securing}


\subsection{SRAM-based PUF Readouts} % (fold)
\label{sub:SRAM-based PUF Readouts}

We will also be considering using SRAM-based PUF readouts in our device configurations in order to get DIDs that are
absolutely unique for each device.

\subsection{Device Fingerprinting} % (fold)
\label{sub:Device Fingerprinting}

For classification of device capabilities NIST has been considering the usage of MUDs, so that devices do not step out
the bounds of their official and appointed capabilities. \cite{dodson2021securing}
